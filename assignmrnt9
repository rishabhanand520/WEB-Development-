// Function to determine the grade based on marks
function gradeStudent(marks) {
    if (marks > 90) {
        console.log("Grade: A");
    } else if (marks >= 70 && marks <= 90) {
        console.log("Grade: B");

Loops in programming are constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a specified condition.
Loops are used to automate repetitive tasks and to iterate over a collection of items such as arrays or objects. They help
in reducing code duplication, improving efficiency, and making the code more concise.

For example, instead of manually writing the same code multiple times, you can use a loop to execute that code as many
times as needed.

Types of Loops in JavaScript
JavaScript provides several types of loops to suit different needs:

for loop
while loop
do...while loop
for...in loop (for objects)
for...of loop (for iterables like arrays)
Letâ€™s go through each one with their syntax and examples.

1. for Loop
The for loop is used when you know beforehand how many times you need to execute a statement or a block of statements. It consists of three parts:

Initialization: Setting the loop counter.
Condition: The loop runs while this condition is true.
Increment/Decrement: Updating the loop counter after each iteration.
Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to be executed
}
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
// Loop from 1 to 5
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
Output:

Copy
Edit
1
2
3
4
5
In this example, the loop runs 5 times. The variable i starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time until it reaches 5.

2. while Loop
The while loop is used when you want to loop through a block of code while a specific condition is true. The condition is
checked before each iteration, and the loop will continue executing as long as the condition evaluates to true.

Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
Output:

Copy
Edit
1
2
3
4
5
In this example, the loop continues as long as i <= 5. The value of i is incremented within the loop.

3. do...while Loop
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but with a key difference: the condition is checked after each 
iteration. This means that the loop will always execute at least once, regardless of whether the condition is true or not.

Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
Output:

Copy
Edit
1
2
3
4
5
In this example, the loop works the same as the while loop, but the condition is checked after the block of code runs.

4. for...in Loop
The for...in loop is used to loop through the properties of an object. It allows you to access the keys of an object.

Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
for (let key in object) {
    // Code to be executed for each key
}
Example:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25, city: "New York" };

for (let key in person) {
    console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}
Output:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
name: Alice
age: 25
city: New York

//question4

const num1 = 10;
const num2 = 25;

// Loop from num1 + 1 to num2
for (let i = num1 + 1; i <= num2; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

//question5
let i = 1;  // Initialize counter variable

// Ascending order using while loop
while (i <= 25) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;  // Increment the counter
}
let i = 25;  // Initialize counter variable

// Descending order using while loop
while (i >= 1) {
    console.log(i);
    i--;  // Decrement the counter
}
