Web design refers to the process of designing the visual appearance and
layout of websites. It involves creating a visual concept, planning the

Web designers use various tools and technologies to create visually
appealing and user-friendly websites. These tools include graphic design
software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, and Figma.
They also use programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
bring their designs to life on the web.

<h1>Web Development</h1>
<p>
Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications. This
involves a combination of different technologies and programming languages, such as HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript, to create web
pages and make them interactive.
<br />
Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and
back-end development. Front-end development deals with the visual aspects of a website or
application, including the design, layout, and user interface. This involves working with
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that can be viewed in a browser.
